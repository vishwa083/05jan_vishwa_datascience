'''How is Memory managed in Python?
-Python has a private heap space that stores all the objects.
-The Python memory manager regulates various aspects of this heap, such as sharing, caching, segmentation, and 
 allocation. 
-The user has no control over the heap; only the Python interpreter has access.'''
