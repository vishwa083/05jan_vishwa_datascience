#How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python? Explain with coding snippets. 
"The try block contains the code that might raise an exception."
"The except block specifies how to handle specific exceptions."
"The finally block contains code that will be executed whether an exception occurred or not."

try:
    result = 10 / 0  
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    print("This will be executed exceptions.")
